# Patch Match Stereo
Build "patchmat-v1" first and then execute it using:
```
./patchmatch path/to/dataset
```
where path/to/dataset is one between Aloe, Cones, Rocks1 (already provided)

N.B. 
The first version of the program is the correct one. The second version is an attempt of improving the first one.
In the report is written why the attempt didn't work and I decided to keep it to show the work done and because,
as it is written in the report, I discovered the reasons behind the fail too late, while I was writing the final report.
