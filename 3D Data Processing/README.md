# 3D Data Processing

In every folder you can find the instructions on how to run the code and a report regarding the work done in that laboratory session.

In every session it was introduced an assignment that we needed to delivery it later on and after that it was given a mark that was part of the final grade.

NOTE: Lab 5 is an oral presentation of a paper proposed by the professor.
