# Reinforcement Learning
In this course I have carried out 2 homeworks by using Google Colab.
The professors gave us 2 python notebook files, with some empty spaces.
Our task was to fill the empty spaces and let the whole notebook work properly.

The 2 topics are:
 - HW1: It is tackle the Multi-Armed Bandit problem and a problem where is requested to use Dynamic Programming
 - HW2: Monte Carlo algorithm, SARSA-λ and SARSA-λ with action-value function approximation are applied to Jackblack game
