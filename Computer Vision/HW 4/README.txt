To run correctly the program you have to pass the input as argument.

Example:

./lab_5.exe <DIRECTORY_PATH> <FIELD_OF_VIEW> <RATIO>

- DIRECTORY_PATH: 	path to the directory containing the image dataset in format *.png or *.bmp
- FIELD_OF_VIEW:  	field of view of the camera used to take the images stored in the directory
- RATIO:          	minimum distance ratio threshold
