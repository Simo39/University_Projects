# Machine Learning
In this course I have carried out 3 homeworks by using Jupyter Notebook.
The professor gave us 3 python notebook files, with some empty spaces.
Our task was to fill the empty spaces and let the whole notebook work properly.

The 3 topics are:
 - LC: Linear Classification
 - SVM: Support Vector Machine
 - NN: Neural Networks and Clustering
 
 The notebooks can be run on Google Colab.
